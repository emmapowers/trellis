# Introduction

Trellis is a reactive UI framework for Python. Build complex web applications with fine-grained state tracking and a clean, declarative API.

## What is Trellis?

Trellis lets you build web UIs entirely in Python. Your components run on the server, render to a React frontend, and stay synchronized via WebSocket.

<TrellisPlayground
  title="Counter Example"
  code={`from dataclasses import dataclass
from trellis import Stateful, component
from trellis import html as h
from trellis import widgets as w

@dataclass
class CounterState(Stateful):
    count: int

    def increment(self):
        self.count += 1

    def decrement(self):
        self.count -= 1

@component
def Counter():
    state = CounterState(count=0)

    with h.Div(style={"padding": "20px", "fontFamily": "system-ui"}):
        with w.Column():
            h.H1("Trellis Counter")
            h.P(f"Count: {state.count}")
            with w.Row():
                w.Button(text="-", on_click=state.decrement)
                w.Button(text="+", on_click=state.increment)

App = Counter`}
/>

## Key Features

- **Fine-grained reactivity**: Only components that read a property re-render when it changes
- **Server-side logic**: All your Python code runs on the server
- **Declarative components**: Describe what the UI should look like, not how to update it
- **Context API**: Share state between components with `with` blocks

## When to Use Trellis

Trellis is designed for:

- Instrument control applications
- Internal tools and admin panels
- Line-of-business applications
- Data-intensive interfaces
- Products where UI is incidental to the core value

It's explicitly **not** for:

- Mobile apps (no native support)
- Slow/unreliable networks (requires persistent WebSocket)
- Marketing sites (not SEO-friendly)
- High-traffic public applications (server-per-user model)
